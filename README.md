👋 Hi, I'm @FullStackAce!

👀 I'm interested in becoming a Full-Stack Engineer. I'm currently learning HTML(finished but ongoing), CSS(finished but ongoing), JavaScript(15% complete), and Python3(10% complete). I'm also interested in learning other languages and technologies, such as React, Node.js, and React Native.

🌱 I'm passionate about building web applications and creating innovative solutions. I'm  a great team player and I'm always looking for ways to collaborate with others.

💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on any projects within the full stack development field. I'm also open to mentorship opportunities.

📫 You can reach me at [justin.ellies@gmail.com] or on Discord at @stackmaster_92095.
